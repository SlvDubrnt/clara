* Multi-distribution

Clara allows to work with different distributions. For that, in config.ini
inside the section [common] you need to list the allowed distributions
in the field "distributions".
E.g.: distributions=calibre8,calibre9

Inside the section [common], you must also set the distribution by
default in the field "distribution"
E.g.: distribution=calibre8

The default distribution configuration parameters will be the ones
specified in the configuration. That is the section [repo] will
have the configuration for calibre8 in our example.
If you want to override some of these parameters for calibre9,
you need to add the section [repo-calibre9].
If the parameter is missing in [repo-calibre9], clara will use instead
the value of the parameter listed in [repo]. If the full section is
missing, clara will use all the values listed in [repo].

Finally, to use other calibre9 instead of the default distribution (calibre8),
you must indicate it to clara with the option  --dist=<distribution>.
E.g.: clara repo init --dist=calibre9
